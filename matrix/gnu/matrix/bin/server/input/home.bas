A scalar multiple of a vector (that is, the product of a real number and
a vector) is the vector whose elements are the multiples of the corresponding
elements of the original vector. Juxtaposition of a symbol for a scalar and a
symbol for a vector indicates the multiplication of the scalar with each element
of the vector, resulting in a vector of the same number of elements.
