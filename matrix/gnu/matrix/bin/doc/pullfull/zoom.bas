There are other types of structures based on graphs that are useful in
representing data. A graph is a structure consisting of two components: a
set of points, called vertices or nodes and a set of pairs of the points, called
edges. (Note that this usage of the word “graph” is distinctly diﬀerent from
the more common one that refers to lines, curves, bars, and so on to represent
data pictorially. The phrase “graph theory” is often used, or overused, to em-
phasize the present meaning of the word.) A graph G = (V, E) with vertices
V = {v1 , . . . , vn } is distinguished primarily by the nature of the edge elements
(vi , vj ) in E. Graphs are identiﬁed as complete graphs, directed graphs, trees,
and so on, depending on E and its relationship with V . A tree may be used
for data that are naturally aggregated in a hierarchy, such as political unit,
subunit, household, and individual. Trees are also useful for representing clus-
tering of data at diﬀerent levels of association. In this type of representation,
the individual data elements are the terminal nodes, or “leaves”, of the tree.
