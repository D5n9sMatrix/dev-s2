For a given matrix X, I will often refer to its inverse X −1 , its determinant
det(X), its Gram X T X, a matrix formed by permuting its columns E(π) X, a
matrix formed by permuting its rows XE(π) , and other transformations of the
given matrix X. These derived objects are very important and useful. Their
usefulness, however, is primarily conceptual.

end type
